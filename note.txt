The unknown type is kind of like the any type, but unlike the "any" type, it has to be type casted before it
can actually be used.



The biggest difference between interface and type is that interface can only be used to type objects, while type can be used to type objects, primitives, and more. As it turns out, type is more versatile and functional than interface

So, why use interfaces.

Since interface may only type objects, itâ€™s a perfect match for writing object-oriented programs because these programs need many typed objects
